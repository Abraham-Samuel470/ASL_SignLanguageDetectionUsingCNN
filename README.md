# ASL Sign Language Detection Using CNN
Welcome to the ASL Sign Language Detection Using CNN project! This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time through webcam input.

---
ðŸŒŸ  **Project Description :** 
The ASL Sign Language Detection Using CNN project aims to bridge communication gaps by recognizing ASL gestures using computer vision and deep learning. This project uses a trained CNN model to classify ASL signs into different categories and display the results in real-time.

ðŸš€ **Features**

**Real-Time ASL Gesture Recognition:** Capture hand gestures through a webcam and classify them in real-time.

**Pre-Trained CNN Model:** A robust CNN model trained on ASL sign data.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive user experience with real-time feedback.

**High Accuracy:** Achieve high accuracy with optimized model architecture.

## Dataset
The project uses an ASL dataset containing images of hand gestures for each letter of the alphabet. You can use publicly available datasets or create your own dataset.

Suggested Dataset Sources:
- [Kaggle ASL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)

## ðŸ“¥ Installation and Set-up
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abraham-Samuel470/ASL_SignLanguageDetectionUsingCNN.git
    cd ASL_SignLanguageDetectionUsingCNN
    ```
2. Interact with the System:
   
    -Show different ASL signs in front of your webcam.
   
    -The system will recognize the gesture and display the corresponding letter or action.

4. Exit the Application:
   
   -Press `ESC` or close the window to stop the detection.
   
5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn
    ```
6. Download or prepare your ASL dataset and place it in the `data` directory or create your own data directory like how i create mine as `ASLdatesheet`.
